Inspired by reddit user [/u/ZeCryptic](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeCryptic) in his recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/9gah62/i_made_a_bongo_cat_cam_for_osu_that_works_in_real/) I was just playing around with a custom version of a realtime bongo cat.

Cursor and keyboard tracking takes place every 50ms as of now.

The screen is split into evenly sized sectors. Each sector gets its own three sprites i.e. tap left, tap right and no tap.
